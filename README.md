# Item-Shipping-Calculator
This code is a item shipping cost calculator. The program will ask you 4 simple questions. The first is what the name of the item is, the second is if it is considered fragile, thirdly the order total, and lastly the destination of the shipment (USA, CAN, AUS). Through this information it will calculate the cost of the shipment of your item through formulas depending on if itâ€™s fragile, where it is shipping to, and how much the order total is.  This is done using given constant variables which vary if the order is more expensive and which country it is being shipped to. All fragile items have a $2.00 flat fee added and any order over $150.00 is free shipping to any country. Shipping to Australia is the most expensive, shipping to Canada is less expensive, shipping to the USA is the cheapest.
